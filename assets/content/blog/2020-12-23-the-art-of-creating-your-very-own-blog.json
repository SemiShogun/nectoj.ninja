A good blog is an area where we can store and share our knowledge with other people that have similar interests. \n\n## What was my reason for creating this blog\n\nI created this site out of my own pure curiosity, to know what it's like to program and maintain a blog, and getting to know how a CMS such as netlify functions.\n\nMaking it has been a rather... assidious task, it required the need to learn how a framework such as Nuxt.js, or how to apply a CMS into your very own blog.\n\nOverall, it took me around 3 days to make this site, but even with all the perseverance, it felt really rewarding once I got it up and running.\n\nAll that's missing now are some blog posts with various subjects on programming and whatnot. I can't wait to share with you the various types of knowledge I've acquired during my career!\n\n**Stay tuned for more blog posts!**"
